# Frontend Homework 2

I have completed my second homework. 
I think I've done everything correctly.

This time I used SCSS, and I have been abusing the nesting option.
The class names are getting longer and longer. Not sure if that's good or bad.

I'm also not sure should I create variables for all colors. I have done that anyway.

There is a section, where I do a lot of repetitive button coloring. I wonder if there's a way to do it faster with mixins.
I tried making a mixin, but since I need it to change both class name and variable name, it doesn't work.
The mixin variable can be changed to string and joined, but it can't be converted back to a variable, 
so in CSS I get "background-color: $my-variable" instead of compiled "background-color: red"

And in the end my git decided to not work and refused to authorise me, 
so I spent more than an hour going through different solutions, and ultimatley uploaded the project by hand.
